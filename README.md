## Introduction

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files that are used to customize and configure your system. This repository contains my personal dotfiles for Linux, including configurations for various applications, shell settings, and scripts to automate tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adnan-Malik-26/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Navigate to the `~/.dotfiles` directory and run the installation script:

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This script will create symbolic links to the configuration files in your home directory, ensuring that your system is configured according to the settings in this repository.

## Included Configurations

- **Shell:** Configuration files for Bash and/or Zsh.
- **Editor:** Configuration files for Vim or Neovim.
- **Git:** Git configuration settings and aliases.
- **Tmux:** Configuration for the terminal multiplexer.
- **Miscellaneous:** Various other configurations for tools and applications.

## Installation

The installation script (`install.sh`) creates symbolic links for each configuration file to your home directory. Before running the script, make sure to back up your existing configurations if you have any.

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

If you encounter any issues or conflicts during installation, you can selectively link files or manually copy the configurations as needed.

## Customization

Feel free to customize any of the configurations to suit your preferences. You can also add your own configurations or scripts to the repository. Create a new branch for your changes, and submit a pull request if you'd like to share your improvements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Be sure to follow the existing coding style and conventions.
