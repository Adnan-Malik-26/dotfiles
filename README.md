## Install
To set up these dotfiles on your system, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your home directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```
2. Navigate to the `~/.dotfiles` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ```
3. Run the installation script:
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```
This installation script will create symbolic links for the configuration files in your home directory, ensuring that your system is configured according to the settings in this repository.
**Note:** Before running the script, make sure to back up your existing configurations if you have any. The script will create a backup directory (`~/.dotfiles_backup`) and move existing configurations there.
